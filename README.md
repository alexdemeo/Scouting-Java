# Scouting-Java
Compiles .plist files created from OS X part of program and put them into an excel spreadsheet

This is the java portion of Team 4557 FIRST Scouting program. It takes a directory of a series of .plist files in as a command line argument. 
It then iterates through all the .plist files in that directory and gathers the data about the robots that these contain. Subsuquently it inserts all the data into a single
excel spreadsheet for easy readability. It is typically executed by pressing the "compile to excel" button in the OSX portion of the program, but can be executed independently
as well.
